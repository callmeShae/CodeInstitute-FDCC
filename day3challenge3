			<h2>preparation</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Run the tap so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavor!</li>
				<li>2. Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)</li>
				<li>3. Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</li>
				<li>4. Tea needs time to unlock all its flavor, so give it 3-4 minutes to steep. this is a perfect time to grab a cookie or daydream about your next vacation.</li>
				<li>5. Before removing the tea bag, gently quish it with a spoon against the side the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.</li>
				<li>6. If you want, throw in some milk, sugar or honey.</li>
				<li>7. Enjoy!</li>
